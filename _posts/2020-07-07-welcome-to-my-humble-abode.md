Well met! You seem to have found your way onto
my quiet corner of the Internet.

I am Philip Alexander Searcy, a student of Computer Science
and Mathematics at the University of St Andrews, in Scotland.
Here, I will write about various pursuits related to my subjects.
Things such as side projects, programming contest questions,
maths problems, and anything else which I might consider
relevant (or just interesting, haha).

I do hope that what you find here will be of value to you - in
any case, thank you for taking the time to read my blog.
